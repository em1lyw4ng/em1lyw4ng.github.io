                <p class="context-description">Tableau, part of Salesforce's larger Customer 360 offerings, provides
                    easy data visualization tools that help businesses discover insights about their clients so they can
                    drive better results.</p>
                <p class="context-description">Under the CRM Analytics team, I worked on improving usability of their
                    iPadOS offering by enabling split-screen mode on an otherwise dated architecture.</p>

                <h3>Breakdown</h3>
                <p>My intern project was to enable split-screen mode for our iPadOS users. Multiple windows support on
                    iPadOS was announced at Apple’s WWDC19 where a SceneDelegate was introduced to iOS architecture.
                    This update meant that I needed to refactor our application alongside implementing the feature to
                    support this new functionality.</p><br>
                <p>As a bonus, implementing a SceneDelegate modularizes UI-related tasks from
                    backend-related tasks. Ultimately, split-screen mode improves usability, and more importantly,
                    empowers CRM Analytics users with the ability to analyze data across multiple screens for more
                    complex data analysis workflows.</p><br>
                <p>Through this project, I was able to communicate with designers, contribute to the product roadmap,
                    get familiar with Objective-C for the first time, and learn tricks for moving around a large
                    existing codebase.</p>

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>This was my first non-remote internship experience, so I navigated an entire new city, made many new
                    friends, and learned a ton about software engineering. I’m most grateful for my exposure to working
                    with large existing codebases, learning about CI/CD pipelines, writing integration and unit tests
                    for 85%+ code coverage, and learning about all different types of software architectures!</p>
                <p>But more importantly, this experience taught me to communicate effectively, often, and adjust how
                    depending on what the problem is and who I was talking to. A truly impactful experience!</p>
