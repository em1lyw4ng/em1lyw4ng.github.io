                    <p>From our data analysis, we found that users interact with the pantry in various ways and fluctuate greatly between being proactive vs. reactive when it comes to adding items to and removing from it. We identified common management behaviors among 2,000 users and synthesized them into 3 personas:</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Ubituitously across all personas, users express <span class="quote">"this app takes some time and devotion in order
                            to work the way it’s intended"</span> because burden is placed on them to cross-check their
                        digital pantry with items in their real-life home pantry. This includes sifting through items to
                        verify that it's expired or relying on memory of what
                        was used before deleting from the app. </p> <br>

                    <p>Within context, approximately 56% of our users are women ages 18-34, busy people who commonly demonstrated that
                        adopting a new habit, especially one that requires effort, can be a big
                        commitment for someone with a busy schedule. Thus, users who don't have the capacity for pantry
                        upkeep tend to feel overwhelmed and begin to view the app more as a task than a
                        helpful kitchen
                        assistant upon seeing the number of outdated or unverified items accumulate in the app.

                <h3>Pantry System Update</h3>

                <p>Our users showed these key insights that helped guide our solution: </p>
                <ol class="centered-list">
                    <li>Users who download productivity apps expect a level of ease and high return on utility</li>
                    <li>It’s difficult for users to invest time in adopting a digital experience</li>
                    <li>Users are busy and have a low tolerance for manual tasks, they seek a balance between maintaining autonomy and benefiting from technology</li>
                </ol><br>

                <p>This led us to redesign the pantry update system and improved our algorithm to identify
                    likely expired or used
                    items, additionally giving users the option to automatically remove them. This redesign emphasizes
                    transparency and user control while reducing manual effort, ultimately helping users keep the pantry up-to-date
                    with less effort.</p> <br>

                <p>This was my first experience leading the end-to-end development of a feature (at a product that I
                    love no less)! I learned how to tackle ambiguous problems with data while keeping users and
                    technical constraints at the forefront of every discussion. Working closely across different domains
                    was something that I really enjoyed, especially as I learned how to better communicate and deliver
                    across
                    each function with every iteration in the process.</p>
